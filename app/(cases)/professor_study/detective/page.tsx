The air is thick with the scent of old leather, spilled ink, and something faintly almond-like. Finch himself is slumped over a grand mahogany desk, his head resting on a scattered pile of manuscripts. The room is a fortress of knowledge, lined wall-to-wall with books, but a profound and unnerving silence has conquered this domain. A single lamp casts a golden glow on the deceased, leaving the corners of the room in deep shadow. From this first glance, there are no obvious signs of struggle; it is a portrait of unnaturally peaceful death.",

Beside his hand lies a beautiful, old-fashioned quill pen with an iridescent feather. Its metallic nib seems unusually sharp, glinting under the lamplight like a serpent's fang.

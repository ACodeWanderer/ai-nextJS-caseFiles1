Detective Sarah Chen receives an urgent call about a high-profile death, the static-filled transmission cutting through the night like a digital scream. The tower rises forty stories into the London sky, a monument to technological ambition where fortunes are made and lost with the click of a mouse. Inside, the building hums with the constant whisper of servers and the soft glow of monitors that never sleep. Security cameras track every movement through corridors lined with startup dreams and corporate nightmares. Tonight, one of those dreams has turned deadly, and the digital realm that promised transparency has become a maze of encrypted secrets and hidden motives.",

Multiple monitors still glow with code and financial data, their screens casting an eerie blue light across his pale features. The office speaks of success and ambition - awards line the walls, and expensive gadgets occupy every surface like trophies of technological conquest. A half-eaten sandwich sits beside his keyboard, suggesting he was working late into the evening, unaware that death was approaching with silent, calculated steps. The air conditioning hums quietly, circulating the sterile atmosphere of corporate power that has now become a tomb.
